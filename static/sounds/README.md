# System Sound Files

This directory contains system sound effects used by the application.

Required files:
- `start.mp3`: Played when starting a conversation
- `end.mp3`: Played when ending a conversation
- `error.mp3`: Played when an error occurs
- `levelup.mp3`: Played when relationship level increases

Note: All sound files should be in MP3 format and kept relatively short (1-2 seconds) for optimal performance.
